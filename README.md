## Project Overview
"Be dedicated to change the way in which people see mental illness at all levels of society. If not for yourself, advocate for those who are struggling in silence.” — Germany Kent

## Motivation
Mental health remains one of the most overlooked aspects of healthcare globally. The stigma surrounding mental health issues often prevents individuals from seeking help, leading to prolonged suffering and a lack of understanding. Whispering Willow aims to bridge this gap by providing a platform that promotes awareness, offers support, and facilitates early intervention for mental health concerns.

## What it does
Whispering Willow is a web-based platform designed to assess an individual's mental health status and provide personalized recommendations based on their results. Users answer a series of questions, and based on their responses, the platform categorizes them into different mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress, schizophrenia, eating disorders, and neurodevelopmental disorders. It offers a range of self-care resources, mood tracking tools, progress monitoring, and helpline assistance.

## How we built it 
Whispering Willow was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The front-end interface was developed with HTML and CSS, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience. JavaScript was utilized to create the interactive questionnaire, analyze user responses, and generate personalized recommendations based on established scoring criteria.

## Challenges 
Building Whispering Willow presented several challenges, including designing an effective questionnaire to accurately assess mental health status, ensuring user privacy and data security, and creating a comprehensive database of resources and support services. Identifying the correct treatment options for individuals based on their mental health assessment proved to be a significant challenge. Overcoming these challenges required careful planning, collaboration, and iterative development processes.

## What we learned 
Through the development of Whispering Willow, we gained invaluable insights into the complexities of mental health awareness and the importance of destigmatizing discussions surrounding mental health. We learned the significance of user-centered design principles, and the ethical considerations involved in handling sensitive user data.

## What is next for Whispering Willow
Whispering Willow is committed to continuously improving and expanding its services to reach a wider audience and provide more comprehensive support for mental health issues. Future plans include integrating machine learning algorithms for more accurate assessments, partnering with mental health professionals for telemedicine consultations, and enhancing community engagement through educational initiatives and outreach programs.
